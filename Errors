#Len () - this function can count the length, however, it does not like working with integars. By having len(123), this will break the code

num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
print("Your name has " + num_char + "characters.")

line 4 will break because num_char is an integar
to check the type
print(type(num_char))

to change line 3:num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))intp a string, you can do str(num_char) and then store it under another name

you can also do
a = 123
print(type(a))
and it should return as an integar

you can do a = str(123); now a is a string
